This project is using spring boot to build two microservices , one responsible for users management and one responsible for events management. Communication
within the microservices is done via HTTP and AMQP protocols. Frontend is built in angular. Everything is built on top of docker containers and the deployment
is handled via kubernetes. This architecture can be easily deployed in any kind of cloud provider (kubernetes cluster).
